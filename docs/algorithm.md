# Pathfinding Algorithms

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Purpose
- Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph
- Explores all possible paths systematically
- Works well in unweighted or uniformly weighted graphs

### Characteristics
- No directional guidance
- Time Complexity: O(VÂ² or E log V)
- Best for finding absolute shortest path without additional information

### Use Cases
- Network routing
- GPS navigation without terrain considerations
- Simple distance-based pathfinding

## A* Algorithm

### Purpose
- Finds shortest path with additional heuristic guidance
- Uses estimated distance to prioritize path exploration
- More efficient in large or complex graphs

### Characteristics
- Incorporates "smart" exploration strategy
- Time Complexity: O(E), can be much faster than Dijkstra
- Requires additional contextual information

### Use Cases
- Game development pathfinding
- Geographical routing with terrain considerations
- Navigation systems with complex routing requirements

## Choosing Between Algorithms

- Use Dijkstra's when: 
  - Graph is relatively small
  - All paths have similar complexity
  - No additional contextual information is available

- Use A* when:
  - Graph is large and complex
  - Additional heuristic information is available
  - Performance is critical
  - Directional guidance can improve pathfinding
